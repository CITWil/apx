# Description: Apx is a wrapper around apt to make it works inside a container
#   from outside, directly on the host.

# Params
DEV_IMPORTS=true
SUBCOMMANDS="clean export unexport enter help init install list log purge remove run search show update upgrade version"
CONTAINER_NAME="apx_managed"
VERSION="0.0.7"
APP_LABEL="â—†"
LOGS_DIR="/var/log/apx"

# Packagers must pre-configure apx placing a file named "packager-rules.cfg" in
# /etc/apx. This file must contain the following variables:
# - PKG_CONTAINER_IMAGE: the image to use for the container e.g. "archlinux:latest"
# - PKG_MANAGER_NEED_SUDO: if the package manager needs sudo to run
# - PKG_MANAGER_INTERFACE: the interface to use for the container e.g. "pacman"
#                          then place a file named "packager-manager-interface.cfg"
#                          in /etc/apx (see the example file "packager-manager-interface.cfg.example"
#                          whcih implements the pacman interface)
